 # ⚖️ Weight Calculator GUI

This project is a **Python GUI application** built with **Tkinter** that helps to calculate the weight distribution of chemical elements in compounds.  
It includes an **interactive periodic table** for selecting elements and a **calculator engine** powered by **Sympy** for solving weight ratio equations.

## 💻 How to Use

1. Start the application with:
```bash
python app.py
```
2. Enter the number of elements.[image](https://github.com/sumannandi-cmp/Weight-Calculator-GUI/blob/main/images/Fig1.png)
3. For each element: Click Select to choose it from the periodic table.[image1](https://github.com/sumannandi-cmp/Weight-Calculator-GUI/blob/main/images/Fig2.png) [image2](https://github.com/sumannandi-cmp/Weight-Calculator-GUI/blob/main/images/Fig3.png)
The symbol and atomic mass will auto-fill.
4. Enter their **ratios**.
5. Choose whether you want to fix:The total weight, or The weight of a specific element
6. Enter their **known weights**, or **total weight**.
7. Click **Calculate** to get results. [image](https://github.com/sumannandi-cmp/Weight-Calculator-GUI/blob/main/images/Fig4.png)

## 🧪 Example

**Water (H₂O):**
- Elements: H and O
- Ratios: 2 and 1
- Total weight: 18 g
- Result:
  - H: ~2.01432 g
  - O: ~15.98568 g
